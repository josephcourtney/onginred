- [x] Use Pydantic’s `alias_generator` (e.g. snake\_case to CamelCase) to eliminate repetitive `alias` declarations in every model.
- [x] Remove explicit `alias` parameters once an `alias_generator` is in place to make model definitions more concise.
- [x] Define TypedDicts for `to_plist_dict` return types to give IDEs precise field completion and validation.
- [x] Replace generic `ValueError` and `KeyError` in user-facing code with custom exception subclasses for clearer error handling.
- [x] Provide context-manager wrappers around plist file writes to handle partial failures and automatic cleanup.
- [x] Offer a `load_from_yaml` or `load_from_json` classmethod to let users declare jobs in config files instead of Python code.
- [ ] Add a CLI entry point (`console_scripts`) for scaffolding new jobs and inspecting existing `.plist` definitions.
- [ ] Enhance model reprs (`__repr__`) to display key config fields for easier debugging in REPL sessions.
- [ ] Expose asynchronous versions of `install`/`uninstall` for integration with async applications.
- [ ] Integrate Hypothesis‐based property tests for cron expansion, path resolution, and socket validation to catch edge cases.
- [ ] Expand the README with minimal, copy-and-paste code snippets covering common use cases.
- [ ] Define a `LaunchdBuilder` class that encapsulates a `LaunchdSchedule` instance.
- [ ] Implement chainable methods on `LaunchdBuilder` such as `.cron(expr: str)`, `.at(hour: int, minute: int)`, `.watch(path: str)`, `.queue(path: str)`, and `.keep_alive()`.
- [ ] Ensure each fluent method applies its change to the appropriate submodel (`TimeTriggers`, `FilesystemTriggers`, `EventTriggers`, `LaunchBehavior`).
- [ ] Return `self` from every builder method to enable method chaining.
- [ ] Add a `.build()` method that returns the fully configured `LaunchdSchedule`.
- [ ] Write unit tests confirming that each fluent call mutates the internal schedule exactly as expected.
